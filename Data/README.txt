ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set
------------------------------------------------------

1. What is it?
--------------

The "ADL Recognition with Wrist-worn Accelerometer Data Set" is a public collection of
labelled accelerometer data recordings to be used for the creation and validation of
acceleration models of simple human activities, called Human Motion Primitives (HMP).
Human Motion Primitives allow for the recognition of mechanical, location-independent
Activities of Daily Living (ADL).
We believe that, in a similar fashion to computer vision public datasets, the adoption
of common testbenches for human activity recognition algorithms will allow for a better
comparison between different approaches and ultimately lead to the development of more
accurate and reliable solutions.
